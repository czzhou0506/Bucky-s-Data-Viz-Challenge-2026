Distribution of Song BPM Across Song Type and Conferences

Based on the data, we can see that songs are split into two categories: low BPM and high BPM. There are no songs that fall in between these two groups. The top-left scatter plot shows BPM values by year, clearly separating songs into low BPM (≤110) and high BPM (>110). Low-BPM songs cluster between roughly 60–90 BPM, while high-BPM songs range from about 110 to 180 BPM.

The top-right stacked bar chart compares official and unofficial songs. Official songs dominate the dataset and include a much higher count of high-BPM tracks than low-BPM ones. Most low-BPM songs are official songs.

The bottom row presents pie charts showing the proportion of high-BPM songs by athletic conference. All conferences have a majority of high-BPM songs, though some conferences prefer low-BPM songs more than others. The SEC (about 35%) is roughly 2.5 times more likely to have low-BPM songs compared to the Big Ten (about 14%).
